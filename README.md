# SC1015 - Mini Project
## :page_with_curl: About
This is our mini project for our module **SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Inteligence**. The dataset we are using is S&P 500. We chose this dataset to compare the accuracy of machine learning models and statistical analysis model in predicting stock prices.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Problem Statement
Are we able to prove S&P 500 to be a reliable index to buy? Will predicting models justify the reliability? Will Machine Learning model or Statistical model be better?

## Data Science Pipline: Ethical Considerations

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a machine learning model (LSTM) seems to be a better model than the mathematical model (ARIMA/SARIMA) in predicting S&P 500 index price....
